Watch out for Orthos Grenade's Big Burst.

Floors 1-6 have no bronze chests, and so no mimics. They also do not drop
demiclones or pomanders of alteration, purity, serenity, storms, raising, or
dread. All of these can be found starting at floor 7.

Pomanders of affluence, flight, and alteration do not drop on floor 9.
