notes:
  - "Same mechanic as the 81+ Humbaba - uses either Triple or Quadruple Skull
    Dasher followed by Heavy Smash. Count the hits and move away IMMEDIATELY
    after the last hit to avoid Heavy Smash"
  - "The hits from Triple/Quadruple Skull Dasher cannot be LoSed or outranged
    (the Warg will chase after the target until it gets in range)"
