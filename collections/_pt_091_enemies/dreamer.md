    get away after it dies"
    warning: explosion
notes:
  - "Immune to knockback, so it cannot be one-shot with the Primordial Flesh
    votive"
  - "The explosion is weaker than other AoEs, and DPS/healers can (barely)
    survive it with double HP from barkbalm incense or the Immolation votive"
  - "The explosion is blocked if the enemy dies while asleep, either from
    damage over time or from direct damage that kills"
