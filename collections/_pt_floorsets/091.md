    subnotes:
      - note: Fire/Blade combo
        subnotes:
          - "Eminent Grief will start casting either Ball of Fire or Chains of
            Condemnation, and Devoured Eater will start casting Blade of First
            Light"
          - "These two casts start at the first time, but one will have a
            shorter cast. Check the cast speeds as well as the ability names
            and boss tells, and dodge appropriately"
  - note: "Rotation (3m30s per cycle):"

      - Bounds of Sin

        subnotes:
          - "The direction in which the boss pulls open the hole (horizontal or
            vertical) indicates the direction the exaflare explosions will move
            later"
      - note: Drain Aether
        subnotes:
          - "Both bosses will cast Drain Aether, but one cast will be shorter
            than the other. Change your light/dark debuff to match them in the
            proper order"

      - Abyssal Blaze resolves
  - note: "There are several light and dark puddles on the arena floor.
    Stepping in one of these applies a 3-minute debuff of that color, which
    inflicts a tiny DoT but also allows you to damage the boss of the opposite
    color: Light Vengeance lets you hit Eminent Grief, and Dark Vengeance lets
    you hit Devoured Eater"
    subnotes:
      - "If you let the debuff expire, you're penalized with a short
        loss-of-control debuff, but since you have to switch colors for Drain
        Aether anyway, this should never be a problem. This mechanic is
        intended more for the Quantum version of the fight, where the debuff
        timer is shorter"
  - "If the bosses' health levels get more than 25% apart, Eminent Grief gains
    a damage-up buff (+30% per stack) and Devoured Eater gains an HP
    regeneration buff (0.1%/3s per stack), stacking once for each percent
    past 25%, so don't focus all your damage on a single boss. Feo Ul can help
    here - she'll always attack whichever boss you hit first, letting you then
    focus on the other one"
  - "Aim Spinelash down the gold lines on the floor to avoid hitting windows.
    If an add does spawn, make sure to kill it quickly or it can hit you with
    Terror Eye while you're trapped by Bounds of Sin"
  - note: "To find the safe corner for Abyssal Blaze, check the boss hands
    direction and crystal layout for the first set of crystals:"
    subnotes:
      - "The crystals will be in a diagonal line - neither of the corners on
        that line is safe"
      - "If the direction is horizontal, the remaining corner on the north is
        safe"
      - "If the direction is vertical, the remaining corner on the south is
        safe"
  - "Don't fall off the edge!"

    timing:
      - "6m15s with strength, haste, and barkbalm incense (7.35)"
---

This set has only 8 floors, with the boss on floor 99 and a short run to the
finish on floor 100.

Do your best to save a barkbalm or at least a mazeroot for the boss - the
fight can take close to 30 minutes on some jobs with no incense or pomanders
to help.

Potsherds do not drop from bronze chests and silver chests do not award
aetherpool increases in this set.
