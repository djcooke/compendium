      - note: Blown Blessing
        subnotes:
          - "The boss will spout either yellow or blue particles, followed by
            the two adds spouting the same color in random order. After
            spouting and moving away, the enemies leave markers behind showing
            where the attacks will hit"
          - "The second cycle is always the opposite color of the first. All
            other cycles are random"
      - note: "Shining Shot OR Saltwater Shot, based on Blown Blessing color"
        subnotes:
          - "For Shining Shot (yellow), position near the third add and move
            toward the boss marker after its AoE lands"
          - "For Saltwater Shot (blue), position near the boss marker and get
            knocked toward each add marker in sequence"
          - "Adds become targetable after the boss's attack resolves"
      - Far Tide OR Near Tide
      - note: Chaser
        subnotes:
          - "Not used in the first cycle"
  - note: "These adds are much more lenient than on floor 10, with lower
    auto-attack damage and more time before their enrage. Most jobs should
    have no trouble with them"
    subnotes:
      - "Relying on barkbalm incense can be risky - if you move away for Near
        Tide, Feo's AoE lightning might miss the adds. It's probably better to
        stay in the middle and take the hit from Near Tide in this case; the
        damage isn't dangerous with the barkbalm HP buff, and Feo will heal you
        up afterwards"
  - "A single Arm's Length or Surecast will cover all three blue knockbacks if
    you use it immediately before the first one"
  - "The outer damage ring deals ~45k unique damage (unaffected by Steel)
    every 3 seconds while standing in it, changing to a 15-second DoT for
    ~18k/tick after leaving"
  - "Feo Ul will defeat the boss in about 3m50s using barkbalm incense with no
    player assistance"

Enemy attacks start getting a bit trickier here. Watch out in particular for:
* Forgiven Perversion's Unto Dust
* Forgiven Petulance's Left/Right Tentacle
* Traverse Soldierstone's Moatmaker

Incense is also fairly rare in floors 31-50, so don't overspend what you bring
in.

Pomanders of affluence, flight, and alteration do not drop on floor 39.

Potsherds do not drop from bronze chests on floors 31-33.
