      boss's laser; orbs will spawn in that same pattern, then explode a short
      time later in spawn order. Move to the first orb as soon as it appears,

    more, and will never hit the same quadrant twice in a row. If you start
    outside the first telegraph, then move into each quadrant as it is hit,
    you can stop at the 5th hit and be safe for the rest of the mechanic"
