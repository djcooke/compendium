    boss's laser; orbs will spawn in that same pattern, then explode a short

    then from orb to orb as they explode"

    more, and will never hit the same quadrant twice in a row. If you start
    outside the first telegraph, then move into each quadrant as it is hit,
    you can stop at the 5th hit and be safe for the rest of the mechanic"
