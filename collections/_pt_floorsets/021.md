A few things to watch out for:

* Forgiven Insult's Holy, which stuns you just like the WHM version
* Traverse Clionid's Parasitism, a heavy damage attack used at low health
* Forgiven Intolerance's Swinge, a late-telegraph pointblank AoE (unlike the
  conal seen in EO 21+)

Pomanders of affluence, flight, and alteration do not drop on floor 29.

Potsherds do not drop from bronze chests on floors 21-23.
