From this set onward, most cast/AoE abilities are deadly to DPS or healers
without Steel. Late-telegraph and untelegraphed attacks are also more common,
so be prepared! Floors 57-59 in particular are full of enemies with "gotcha"
moves.

Aetherpool upgrades from silver chests on this set award an additional +1 over
their usual values (+2/+3/+4 instead of +1/+2/+3).

Bronze chests on this set can drop up to 4 items.

Completing this set awards a +4/+4 aetherpool upgrade.
