boss_notes:
  - note: "Rotation (56s per cycle):"
    subnotes:
      - Branch Out
      - "Adds move in random patterns, eventually ending up with two on one
        side of the arena and one on the other"
      - Hedge Mazing (boss and adds simultaneously)
      - Adds become targetable and start auto-attacking
      - note: Leafmash (4 telegraphs, then 4 hits in the same order)
        subnotes:
          - "Any adds still alive become untargetable and use Little Leafmash
            at the same time each Leafmash hit lands, then die after Leafmash
            completes"
  - "If any adds live long enough to use Little Leafmash, they will probably
    wipe a solo player either from the damage itself or from being stunlocked
    and caught in the boss's Leafmash. Most jobs will need to save some
    cooldowns to burst down the adds in time"
  - "Barkbalm incense will help, but don't count on it as a guaranteed kill for
    the adds because Feo Ul's lightning ability doesn't sync with the boss
    rotation. The adds are immune to mazeroot (and pomander) witching"
boss_job_specifics:
  WHM:
    notes:
      - "Strength or barkbalm incense recommended"
      - note: "Save Assize for adds, combine with one of:"
        subnotes:
          - "Glare IV burst. If no Strength, target each add once to ensure
            they die"
          - "With Strength: Afflatus Misery + 1-2 casts of Holy (depending on
            level)"
          - "Without Strength: Afflatus Misery on one add + Glare III to finish
            off the other two"
          - "If you accidentally use Assize early, you need 3 more Holy casts
            to cover it. Swiftcast the last Holy to make sure you beat the DPS
            check"
      - "Use movement time during Leafmash to recover your blood lily"
      - "The boss rotation is less than 1m, so you won't get all your lilies
        back each cycle. Save a Glare IV burst if Misery won't be ready for
        the adds"
    timing:
      - "6m15s with strength at level 95 (7.35)"
      - "5m with strength at level 98 (7.35)"

Enjoy the scenery! Enemy AoEs on early sets will hurt but not kill (other than
Mimics' Deathtrap, which can still be survived with Steel or as a tank).

Floors 1-6 have no bronze chests, and so no mimics. They also do not drop
pomanders of alteration, purity, serenity, purification, raising, or devotion.
All of these can be found starting at floor 7. Silver chests *do* drop incense
from floor 1 onwards, unlike HoH magicite and EO demiclones.

Pomanders of affluence, flight, and alteration do not drop on floor 9.

Potsherds do not drop from bronze chests on this set.
