      - "Profane Waul (Whiskers) and Roaring Ring OR Perilous Lair with debuffs"

  - note: "Nohere to Run is a pink-colored debuff, also signaled by 'Death approaches all who tread forth...' text in the center of the screen. It will trigger after 8 steps in any direction, so stay close to the boss and dodge the whiskers + point blank/ring."
  - note: "Shadows of Death is a purple-colored debuff, also signaled by 'All who deny Light are condemned to death...' text in the center of the screen. Players must cleanse the debuff by intentionally being hit with Profane Waul (whiskers), or else they will die at the end of the debuff timer. Players must still dodge the Roaring Ring or Perilous Lair."
  - note: "Try to keep the boss near to the center for each Profane Waul (Whiskers) and Roaring Ring OR Perilous Lair as being near a wall and solving Perilous Lair can be difficult."
  - note: "The most dangerous mechanic are the debuffs in tandem with Profane Waul (Whiskers) and Roaring Ring OR Perilous Lair. 
  - note: "The damage of Stalking Static shouldn't kill any job with full aetherpool, but does apply a long paralysis debuff, which can be cleansed with Esuna, Bard's cleanse, or Pomander of Purification."
