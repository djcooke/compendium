        subnotes:
          - "Resolve debuffs during this cast"
  - note: 'Shadows of Death is a purple-colored debuff, also signaled by popup
    text reading "All who deny Light are condemned to death..." in the center
    of the screen, causing instant death on expiration. To cleanse the debuff,
    intentionally take a hit from Profane Waul (the light-colored half-room
    AoE) while dodging Perilous Lair or Roaring Ring (pointblank/donut) as
    usual'
    subnotes:
      - "Profane Waul's damage is reduced to a trivial amount and does not
        inflict vulnerability up if it hits this debuff"
  - note: 'Nowhere to Run is a red-colored stacking debuff, also signaled by
    popup text reading "Death approaches all who tread forth..." in the center
    of the screen. The debuff starts at 1 stack and gains a stack every time
    the player moves a certain distance, triggering instant death if it reaches
    8 stacks before expiring. Stay close to the boss and find the nearest safe
    spot when the pointblank/donut cast starts'
    subnotes:
      - "Unlike Shadows of Death, this debuff is NOT removed when the boss AoEs
        resolve, so stay still until you see the debuff expire!"
  - "Try to keep the boss near the center of the arena so there's enough room
    to escape Perilous Lair regardless of whiskers direction"
  - "All paralysis and bleeding debuffs are curable, so a pomander of
    purification can help if you take a hit from a mechanic"
  - "Feo Ul will defeat the boss in about 9m30s using barkbalm incense with no
    player assistance"
