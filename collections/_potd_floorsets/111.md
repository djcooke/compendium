      - 'Gold Dust'
      - 'Leafstorm'
      - 'Boss runs to north end and stays there until after Rotten Stench
      phase'
      - 'Two Deep Palace Hornet adds appear'
      - 'Rotten Stench x3'
  - 'Full rotation takes 56 seconds'
  - 'Kill adds quickly, or they will use Final Sting, which does 70% max HP
  damage (each). This can be outranged, but the adds will keep using it
  repeatedly until it hits or they die'
  - 'If you use lust during the second Rotten Stench cast, it will last long
  enough to kill 2 sets of adds. Steel may be needed to survive long enough on
  non-tanks though'
  - 'Rotten Stench will one-shot a DPS or healer without steel'
boss_job_specifics:
  BRD:
    timing:
      - "~5m with strength (6.55)"
    notes:
      - "Risky without strength; might not kill adds in time"
      - "Steel is not required"
  GNB:
    timing:
      - '4m with strength and 1 lust used to kill 2 sets of adds (6.15)'
    notes:
      - 'Strength recommended'
      - 'Superbolide can be used to block Final Sting from both adds, allowing
      you to ignore one set'
  MCH:
    timing:
      - '5m30s with no offensive pomanders (6.28)'
      - '3m45s with strength (6.45)'
    notes:
      - Easy with no pomanders
  PCT:
    timing:
      - '2m with strength and 1 lust (7.16)'
  PLD:
    timing:
      - '9m with no offensive pomanders, killing only 1 bee per set (6.0)'
      - '6m30s with 1 lust to AoE first adds and boss, ignoring second set of
      adds by using Hallowed Ground for Final Stings, and killing only 1 bee
      per set after that (6.0)'
      - '6m15s with strength and 1 lust used to AoE first adds and boss, and
      killing all adds (6.0)'
    notes:
      - 'Strength recommended'
      - 'Probably best to save Fight or Flight for adds (though boss rotation
      is slightly quicker than recast time)'
      - 'Without strength, you won''t be able to consistently kill both adds.
      Instead, you can kill one and eat Final Sting from the other. Just make
      sure your HP is full for it. The boss will do Acid Mist at the same time,
      allowing you to heal up safely'
      - 'Hallowed Ground can be used to block Final Sting from both adds,
      allowing you to ignore one set'
  RPR:
    timing:
      - '2m30s with strength and 1 lust (7.21)'
  SGE:
    timing:
      - '6m20s with no offensive pomanders (6.28)'
      - '5m15s with 1 lust used to clear 2 sets of adds (6.28)'
      - '5m with strength (6.28)'
    notes:
      - 'Easy with strength'
      - note: 'Without strength, use 1 Phlegma + Dyskrasia to kill each pair of
      adds. Timing is tight but consistent - you should kill the adds just as
      they start casting Final Sting'
        subnotes:
          - 'Boss rotation is slightly longer than Phlegma recast time, so if
          you have 2 casts ready when the adds spawn, you can safely use them
          both'
      - 'If you''re late dodging a poison AoE, it''s faster to just tank both
      AoEs and Esuna afterward than to interrupt a Dosis cast to get out'
      - 'Steel not needed when lusting thanks to Kardia'
  WAR:
    timing:
      - '6m30s with 1 lust to AoE first adds and boss, ignoring second set of
      adds by using Holmgang for Final Stings, and killing only 1 bee per set
      after that (6.10)'
      - '4m30s with strength, 1 lust used to AoE first adds and boss, ignoring
      second set of adds by using Holmgang for Final Stings, and killing only 1
      bee per set after that (6.08)'
    notes:
      - 'Holmgang can be used to survive Final Stings, allowing you to ignore
      one set of adds'
      - 'For a faster kill, you can skip killing one of the adds in each set.
      Just make sure you''re at full HP for Final Sting, and have a heal ready
      before the boss comes back at you. The boss uses Acid Mist at the same
      time as the adds'' Final Sting, so this is actually pretty safe.'
  WHM:
    timing:
      - "7m15s with no offensive pomanders (7.16)"
    notes:
      - "Easy with strength"
      - "Without strength, make sure to save your Assize for the adds. Aero
      the adds as soon as they spawn, then Assize + 3 Stone IIIs on each. If
      your Aero is late, autoattacks on the adds can make up for a DoT tick"
      - "If you're late dodging a poison AoE, it's faster to just tank both
      AoEs and Esuna afterward than to interrupt a Stone cast to get out"

Things to watch out for:

* slime enrage
* snakes if you hit a toading trap
* random AoE from Nankas when out of combat

Lots of [wall traps](/pages/wall_traps.html#potd-111-129) here also.
