Almost there! Time to stop playing conservatively and use everything you've
got! Go in with a plan based on what pomanders you have.

* Always use raising immediately if you have it. More do not drop in this set
  unfortunately
* Use fortunes/affluences early if you need pomanders
* Most enemies die in 2-3 hits from resolution
  * Generally best used on the late floors, but consider using on early floors
    if there are a lot of corse patrols, as avoiding them can be very
    time-consuming
  * Note which enemies are immune to stun, as you'll probably be taking hits
    from them while getting your second/third shots off. Consider using steel
  * Use witching first to make this a little safer. Just be careful with imps
    still
* The early floor mobs are easiest, so best to save flights and rages for mid
  or late floors
* Don't forget to use up your safties and sights

Be aware of the [wall traps](/wall_traps.html#potd-151-199) on these floors.
