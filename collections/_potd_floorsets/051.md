          - 'Flames appear around the edges of the arena and do telegraphed
            pointblank AoEs at the same time. Make sure to get knocked into a
            safe spot or use knockback immunity. The flames explode a couple
            seconds after the knockback, so there is a bit of time to adjust.
            Flame explosions deal 70% max HP damage'

The set everyone spams for exp. Watch out for the
[wall traps](/wall_traps.html#potd-51-79).

Pomander of resolution does not drop at all on this set. Affluence, flight, and
alteration do not drop on floor 59.

Potsherds do not drop from bronze chests on floors 51-53.
