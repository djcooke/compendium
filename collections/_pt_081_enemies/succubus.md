    description: "untelegraphed circle AoE on random player (the player is
    indicated with an arrow marker but the circle is not telegraphed). Inflicts
    Pyretic (3s); taking any action (including moving or facing a different
    direction) before the debuff runs out inflicts damage at potency 5000,
    which is generally a one-shot. The attack can be LoSed"
    warning: other
notes:
  - note: 'As of patch 7.35, the Pyretic debuff can trigger even if you remain
    perfectly still. This seems to be caused by the "Automatically face target
    when using action" setting in the character target settings, so if you do
    get hit, make sure to untarget the succubus before it starts moving'
    subnotes:
      - "It's still safer to LoS or stun"
