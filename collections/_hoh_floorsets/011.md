Be aware of the Hands' enrage. Also, there are some
[wall traps](/wall_traps.html#hoh-1-19) here.

Floor 15 is always a hall of fallacies. Elder magicite cannot be found in this
set. Pomanders of affluence, flight, and alteration do not drop on floor 19.

Potsherds do not drop from bronze chests on floors 11-13.
