Be aware of Sekiban and Mizumimizu enrages, and also the
[wall trap](/wall_traps.html#hoh-41-79) on these floors.

Some odd notes about the enemies...

* There are two different enemies named Sekizo - one a patrol, and one not.
  They are both golems, but look different.
* There are two different enemies named Iseki. They are both Maroliths, but one
  is green, and the other is purple.
* There are two different enemies named Saikoro. They are identical except that
  one casts Aero while the other casts Tornado, and they appear on different
  floors.

Pomanders of affluence, flight, and alteration do not drop on floor 49.

Potsherds do not drop from bronze chests on floors 41-43.
