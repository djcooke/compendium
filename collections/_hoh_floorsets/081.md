          - 'C 3 posts north/counter-clockwise from B (just right of the exit)'
      - 'Do whatever for the first 15% - doesn''t really matter.'
      - 'Before Onra hits 85%, position him so that he''s standing on the A
      marker and facing south'
      - 'When he starts casting Ancient Quaga, go behind him. This prevents an
      auto-attack immediately after Ancient Quaga'
      - 'Wait for Onra to turn around and make one auto-attack. This is
      important for positioning Meteor Impact'
      - 'Immediately run just past B. You need to move right after the auto to
      avoid a black orb AoE. You want Onra to stop on the B marker'
      - 'Wait for one auto-attack, then run to C, which will get you out of
      Aura Cannon'
      - 'Wait for Burning Rave, then move to B'
      - 'Wait for Knuckle Press, then move Onra back to A facing south'
      - 'Repeat from Ancient Quaga'
  - "The delay from the Meteor Impact cast to the meteor actually dropping is
    random. Rarely it can drop *very* quickly, even before Aura Cannon, and
    deal potentially fatal damage. Steel can help mitigate this risk for jobs
    that can spare it"

Don't forget to use a pomander of raising at the start of the set. More cannot
be found here, unfortunately. Be very careful if you're going for hoards!

Floors 84-86 are the worst, mainly due to Shinzei patrols that nobody wants to
fight. These are usually good candidates for
flight/alteration/petrification/magicite.

Floors 87-89 are known to have a lot of landmines. Tanks especially can use
pomander of sight on these floors to take advantage of this.
