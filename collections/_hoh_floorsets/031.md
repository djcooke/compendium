Be aware of Harakiri and Onmitsu enrages.

There are two different enemies named Onmitsu - one a patrol, and one not.

Elder magicite is a possible find starting in this set. Pomanders of affluence,
flight, and alteration do not drop on floor 39.

Potsherds do not drop from bronze chests on floors 31-33.
