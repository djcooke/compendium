Don't forget to use a pomander of raising at the start of the set. More cannot
be found here, unfortunately. Be very careful if you're going for hoards!

Floors 91-93, the best thing to fight solo are WHMs. If you can LoS their Stone
casts, you can avoid taking any damage. You can practice LoSing on Sprites down
on floor 11+, as it is not easy. You'll likely want to avoid WARs.

Floors 94-96 are the worst in this set, so ideal to use
flight/alteration/petrification/magicite on.

Floors 97-99 actually have the easiest enemies. 99 is guaranteed to have 3
enchantments, so do your best to save a serenity for it.
