Silver chests have significant chance to be demiclones. No protomanders of raising drop on this set. The final boss is on
floor 99. Floor 100 is just a long run to the finish. Make sure you have time
for this as it takes about 1m5s with 2 sprints - one at the start and another
just before the finish.
