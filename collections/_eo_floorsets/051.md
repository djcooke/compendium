boss_notes:
  - note: "Initial actions:"
    subnotes:
      - Octuple Swipe
      - Disorienting Groan OR Bullish Swing
      - Bullish Swipe (random target)
  - note: "Rotation after opening (58s per cycle):"
    subnotes:
      - Thundercall
      - Octuple Swipe
      - Disorienting Groan OR Bullish Swing
      - Bullish Swipe (random target)
  - note: "The boss rotates to face the player before Octuple Swipe, so the
    first swipe will always be toward the player. The first four swipes are in
    the order front > back > right > left (relative to boss orientation), and
    the next four are either the same order or reversed"
    subnotes:
      - "The initial order is random, but it swaps for each following rotation.
      If you just saw forward order, the next rotation will be reverse order,
      and vice versa"
  - note: "Trick for Octuple Swipe:"
    subnotes:
      - "Stand outside of the first spot"
      - "The only attack that might repeat in the same area is 4 and 5"
      - "If there is no repeat, follow all of the attacks - always stand where
      the last one hit"
      - "If there was a repeat, follow the attacks until the one that repeats.
      Wait for both hits in that area, then move into it and stay there"
  - "Arm's Length or Surecast will block the Disorienting Groan knockback, but
    since each rotation takes slightly less than a minute, the ability may not
    come back in time for the second next cycle"
  - "A Doga demiclone will defeat the boss in about 8m15s with no player
    assistance"
