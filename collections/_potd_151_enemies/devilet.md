    description: 'Grants counterattack (magic potency 200, 5s) to self; can be
    interrupted. Recommended to interrupt or disengage immediately. The damage
    can kill you very quickly'

    potency: 130
    type: Magic
    description: 'Inflicts slow (20s); can be interrupted. It only has medium
    range, so you can also run away to avoid it'
notes:
  - 'Disengaging during Ice Spikes and running away to avoid Void Blizzard is
    probably the safest option as you avoid all damage'
  - 'Some people prefer to disengage during Ice Spikes and stun/interrupt Void
    Blizzard. Make sure to disengage again quickly, but you will probably still
    get one auto-attack in and take Ice Spikes damage.'
  - "Can only be slowed with Arm's Length if transfigured via Pomander of
  Witching since it doesn't normally do melee auto-attacks"

  GNB:
    difficulty: Medium
    notes:
      - 'Try to stun/interrupt both Ice Spikes and Void Blizzard'
  MCH:
    difficulty: Medium
    notes:
      - 'Annoying to fight, so avoid if possible. Not too bad if you''re smart
        about it though'
      - 'Heat Blast recast is not affected by slow, so another option is to
        interrupt Ice Spikes and Hypercharge/Heat Blast away while slowed by
        Void Blizzard'
      - 'Make sure to keep sustaining pots up as kiting won''t help to mitigate
        damage'

    notes:
      - 'Stun Ice Spikes or disengage until it wears off'
  SGE:
    difficulty: Easy
    notes:
      - 'Not especially dangerous, but slow to fight because you''ll have to
        sleep Void Blizzard or Esuna the slow debuff every time it comes up'
      - 'Slow is affected by diminishing returns, so this enemy isn''t as bad
        if you can fight several in a row'
  SMN:
    difficulty: Medium
    notes:
      - "Magic damage doesn't trigger Ice Spikes, so keep attacking"
      - "Ideally use Garuda when slowed, as its recast isn't affected"
