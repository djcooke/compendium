    3m) on players, and grants evasion up (3m) to any other enemies it hits"

notes:
  - "The vulnerability up from Peculiar Light is a non-stacking debuff separate
    from other vuln-up effects. It also nullifies the vulnerability down buff
    from the Steel pomander and prevents you from reapplying it until the
    debuff wears off"
