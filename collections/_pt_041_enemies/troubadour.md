notes:
  - "Moves very slowly, but its attacks hurt. Keep your distance when possible"
  - "Be careful fighting other enemies alongside one of these - it's easy to
    forget about the Tortoise Stomp cast until the telegraph flashes under you
    and you die"

  - "If you get hit with an auto-attack, make sure to wait for the debuff to
    fall off before reapplying Steel, or the pomander will be wasted!"
