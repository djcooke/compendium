    description: 'Increases damage dealt and HP recovered via healing magic by
    30%. Duration: 8 minutes'

    description: 'Decreases damage received by 40%. Duration: 8 minutes'
    tips:

    tips:
      - 'Ideal to combine with affluence to make it easier to collect all of
      the chests'

      enemies that are affected'
  - name: Alteration
    image: alteration.png
    description: 'Changes all enemies occupying a random room on the next floor
    into mimics or mandragoras.'

      - 'If you get mandragoras, easy kills!'
      - 'There are some floors where even mimics are better to fight than a lot
      of other things - see PotD 187-189'
      - 'If you get mimics, there''s also the chance that you''ll be able to
      avoid them'
      - 'Both mimics and mandragoras have a high chance of dropping chests, so
      this can also help with pomander recovery'
      - 'Not ideal to combine with flight, as that will halve the number of
      enemies that are affected'

      to kill a lot of enemies on a floor'

      Fallacies'
  - name: Witching
    image: witching.png
    description: 'Transforms all targets within range into a frog, imp, or
    chicken.'
    tips:
      - 'This is a good panic button when you agro a second mob or hit a luring
      trap'
      - 'Be aware that imps still do significant damage'
        - 'Imp: 60% base autoattack damage'
        - 'Chicken: 30% base autoattack damage'
        - 'Frog: negligible (<1%) damage'
      - 'Necessary for landmining tactics on later floors. Remember to use only when mobs are grouped'
  - name: Serenity

    description: 'Removes all enchantments from the current floor.'
    tips:
      - 'Use when you can''t deal with the floor enchantments and don''t want
      to use a rage/petrify/magicite - especially if you have other beneficial
      effects such as strength, steel, flight, or alteration running'
      - 'Make sure to save one for HoH floor 99, which always has 3
      enchantments.'
  - name: Intuition
    image: intuition.png
    description: 'Reveals the floor''s hidden treasure.'
    tips:
      - 'It''s very rare to go 3 floors in a row without a hoard, so use on the
        7th floor in a set at the latest (assuming you didn''t already get a
        hoard on the 7th floor.'
      - 'Keep at 2 except on sets before it changes to a better hoard type.
      (e.g. better to keep at 3 on HoH 61-70, so you have 3 at the start of the
      platinum sack floors)'
      - 'Use ASAP in PotD 151+ and HoH 71+. Just be careful of traps! Easiest
      to collect on floors you''re planning to wipe, or where you''ve used
      safety/sight.'
  - name: Raising
    image: raising.png
    description: ''
    tips:
      - 'Use when there''s a good chance you''re going to die!'

      things you don''t want to fight'
      - 'Make sure you know where the exit is if you''re trying to clear the
      path. Consider using sight if necessary'
      - 'Watch out for traps, as an unexpected luring trap or landmine can pose
      a problem. Sight or safety might be a good idea if you''re planning to
      run into the middle of a room'
      - 'An efficient use is to clear one floor and get to the exit with time
      still left to get some kills on the next floor'
  - name: Lust

    only_in: PotD
    description: 'Transforms user into a succubus. Grants ability "Void Fire

    only_in: HoH
    description: 'Weakens all enemies on current floor. Duration: 3 minutes'

  - name: Concealment
    image: concealment.png
    only_in: HoH

    tips:
      - 'Great for getting past treasure rooms or proximity mobs that are
      blocking your way to the exit'
      - 'Can be used in HoH Hall of Fallacies to test for traps in fake beacons as they will not pulse'
      - 'The effect will be cancelled if you use an ability or pomander, open
      a silver chest that explodes, or get hit by an enemy''s out-of-combat
      abilities. It is safe to use Sprint though'
  - name: Petrification

    only_in: EO
    description: "Inflicts all enemies on the floor with a very potent slow.
    Auto-attack delay as well as weaponskill and spell cast and recast time are
    increased. Duration: 10 minutes"
    tips:
      - "Good panic button like witching"
      - "Use for enemies you're unfamiliar/unconfident with. EO enemies have a
      lot of abilities with late telegraphs, so this will give you more time to
      react"
      - "Can use on floors with enemies that have dangerous out-of combat AoEs
      (e.g. sasquatches) to reduce risk"
  - name: Storms
    image: storms.png
    only_in: EO
    description: "Reduces the HP of all enemies on the current floor to a
    single digit"
    tips:
      - "Gather up a few enemies before using, then finish them all with a
      single AoE. If the enemies are dangerous, you can use a witching for
      safety"
      - "Enemies are also affected by the Auto-heal Penalty enchantment which
      makes this an easy floor wipe. Consider combining with fortune"
  - name: Dread
    image: dread.png
    only_in: EO
    description: "Transforms user into a dreadnaught. Grants ability Rotosmash
    that kills most enemies in one hit, and Wrecking Ball that inflicts
    vulnerability up"
    tips:
      - 'Rotosmash does not kill in one hit on floors that have knockback
      disabled'
      - 'Be aware that dread beasts are immune to knockback, so Rotosmash will
      not kill them either'
      - "Using Rotosmash to get a lot of quick kills is generally far more
      valuable than putting vulnerability down on a boss. You could use one to
      clear the floor before a boss, hop in the passage, and get stacks on the
      boss before it wears off though."
      - "See Pomander of Rage from PotD for more tips, as this is much the
      same"

efficiently is key to getting a solo clear. Below is a description of each
