## PotD 1-9

<div class="surfacePane" markdown="1">

* South-east corner of this room:
  <br><img class="noteImage" src="{{ '/assets/images/wall_traps/potd_1_1.png' | relative_url }}">
* South-east corner of this donut room - note that a trap can also spawn
  slightly outward from this point, so hug the railing when passing this
  corner:
  <br><img class="noteImage" src="{{ '/assets/images/wall_traps/potd_1_2.png' | relative_url }}">
* Next to the east exit of the same donut room - note that the wall might be
  closed off instead, and it might be possible to squeeze by in that case:

## PotD 11-19

  <br><img class="noteImage" src="{{ '/assets/images/wall_traps/potd_11_1.png' | relative_url }}">
* West wall of the same donut room (2 locations) - can be avoided if the wall
  is open:

  <br><img class="noteImage" src="{{ '/assets/images/wall_traps/potd_11_2-2.png' | relative_url }}">

  <br><img class="noteImage" src="{{ '/assets/images/wall_traps/potd_11_4.png' | relative_url }}">

  <br><img class="noteImage" src="{{ '/assets/images/wall_traps/potd_11_6.png' | relative_url }}">
* South-east corner of this room (right of the entrance) - not technically a
  wall trap, but you have to jump onto the rocks to avoid it:
  <br><img class="noteImage" src="{{ '/assets/images/wall_traps/potd_11_7.png' | relative_url }}">
* South-west corner of this room (right of the entrance) - there's another
  spawn point just past this which you have to jump onto the rocks to avoid:
  <br><img class="noteImage" src="{{ '/assets/images/wall_traps/potd_11_8-1.png' | relative_url }}">
