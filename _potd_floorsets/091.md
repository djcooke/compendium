    vulnerability stacks to the boss'
  - 'Adds remain on the battlefield when killed, and will be resurrected after
    a while if not cleared with resolution'
  - 'Resolution can be used to kill adds in one shot. It can also be used on
    the corpses to remove them from the battle, preventing them from
    resurrecting'
  - 'You''ll want to use at least one resolution to clear most, if not all, of
    the adds. They are likely to overwhelm you otherwise'

There are a lot of proximity mobs here, and a lot of undead. Everything except
swarms, roselets, and hippogryphs can be killed quickly with resolution. Just
make sure to save one or more for the boss. Watch out for the
[wall trap](/wall_traps.html#potd-81-109).

Floors 91-95 have 2-3 enemies per room; floors 96-99 have 3-4 enemies per room.

Pomanders of affluence, flight, and alteration do not drop on floor 99.

Potsherds do not drop from bronze chests on floors 91-93.

These are the last of the storyline floors.
