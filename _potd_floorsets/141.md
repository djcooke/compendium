boss_notes:
  - note: 'Rotation:'
    subnotes:
      - 'Void Fire IV'
      - 'Summon Darkness (Gargoyle): calls an untargetable gargoyle that will
        use a large telegraphed line AoE at the same time as Dark Mist'
      - 'Dark Mist'
      - 'Summon Darkness (Zombies): calls 4 zombie adds that will slowly crawl
        towards you. If one touches you, you will be bound until it dies'
      - 'Void Fire IV'
      - 'Void Aero'
      - 'Summon Darkness (Vodoriga): calls an untargetable vodoriga that will
        use a telegraphed circle AoE just after the next Void Fire IV'
      - 'Void Fire IV'
      - 'Dark Mist'
      - 'Summon Darkness (Succubus): calls a succubus add - in addition to
        autoattacks, uses Sweet Steel and Void Fire II'
      - 'Void Aero'
      - 'Void Fire IV'
      - 'Fatal Allure'
      - 'Blood Sword - the HP drain is 1:1, so whether you DPS the add or the
        boss doesn''t matter in terms of damage'
      - 'Blood Rain - kills any remaining zombies'
  - 'Entire rotation is about 1m50s'
  - 'Don''t let the zombies catch you'
  - 'Physical ranged jobs can just kite the zombies until they despawn. It''s
    likely better for others to kill them. They have pretty low HP'
  - 'If you''re not killing the succubus add, it''s worth putting DoTs on it
    anyway'
boss_job_specifics:
  GNB:
    timing:
      - '6m45s with strength, 1 lust, and steel at least until lust is done.
      Lust used when first set of zombies is gathered in middle, and spammed
      for the full duration to take out the zombies, damage the boss, and also
      damage the succubus a lot (6.15)'
    notes:
      - 'Strength highly recommended'
      - 'Gather zombie adds in the middle and AoE them down. You can get hit by
      the Void Fire IV AoE from boss - its damage is pretty low. You''ll want
      to get out of the second AoE that comes in right after though'
  MCH:
    timing:
      - '7m15s with no offensive pomanders (6.0)'
      - '4m45s with strength (6.28)'
    notes:
      - 'More comfortable with steel, but not necessary'
      - 'Blood Rain hurts without steel, so make sure to keep your HP topped'
      - 'Kite and ignore all adds; focus down the boss'
  PLD:
    timing:
      - '10m15s with 7m30s strength and 1 lust used to AoE first adds (6.0)'
      - '9m with 1 full strength and 1 lust used to AoE first adds (6.0)'
    notes:
      - 'Steel recommended'
      - 'Gather zombie adds in the middle and AoE them down. Probably want to
      save Fight or Flight and Circle of Scorn for this. You can get hit by the
      Void Fire IV AoE from boss - its damage is pretty low. You''ll want to
      get out of the second AoE that comes in right after though. Maybe use
      Hallowed Ground if you''re not going to make it out, but it is possible
      to kill the adds fast enough even without strength'
      - 'Put DoTs on the succubus add, but focus the boss'
  RPR:
    timing:
      - '4m45s with strength (6.0)'
  SGE:
    timing:
      - '12m45s with no offensive pomanders (6.28)'
      - '9m with strength (6.28)'
      - '8m with strength and 1 lust (6.0)'
    notes:
      - 'Kite and ignore zombies. Save your Phlegma casts for AoEing Tisiphone
      and the succubus add, but be careful of the add''s damage if you don''t
      have steel up'
      - 'Should deal around 14% net damage per cycle without strength'
  SMN:
    timing:
      - '4m15s with strength and 1 lust (6.0)'
  WAR:
    timing:
      - '16-17m with no offensive pomanders (6.2)'
      - '8m30s with 1 strength, 1 lust, and steel at least until lust is done.
      Lust used when first set of zombies is gathered in middle, and spammed
      for almost the full duration to take out the zombies, damage the boss,
      and also damage the succubus a lot. Dropped when HP got low. Steel helps
      stay in lust longer. This is a conservative timing - it is possible to
      kill her just before the 4th Fatal Allure, taking only 7m15s (6.10)'
    notes:
      - 'Not bad without steel; just keep your HP up for Blood Rain'
      - 'Gather zombie adds in the middle and AoE them down. You can get hit by
      the Void Fire IV AoE from boss - its damage is pretty low. You''ll want
      to get out of the second AoE that comes in right after though'
      - 'If not using strength, save Berserk or gauge for zombies'

Things start getting a bit more painful here with several hard-hitting enemies.
Watch out for random Succubus AoEs cast out of combat. Demons have an enrage
also. There are more [wall traps](/wall_traps.html#potd-131-149) too.
