      - 'Charybdis (x2)'
      - 'Thunderbolt'
      - 'Charybdis'
      - 'Trounce again, but from the north end'
  - Enters enrage mode at 15% - stands up and casts Ecliptic Meteor, dealing
    80% max HP damage to everyone in the party. Continues to cast this over and
    over until the fight ends
  - 'If you are standing in front of him during meteors, he can also autoattack
    you (so don''t do that!)'
  - 'Most jobs require a very strict strategy to get through this final push.
    See the job-specific notes below'
  - note: 'Useful macros:'
    subnotes:
    - note: 'Cancel Lust: /statusoff "Transfiguration"'
      subnotes:
        - 'Useful if you have trouble clicking it off quickly'
    - note: 'Cancel food: /statusoff "Well Fed"'
      subnotes:
        - 'Again useful if you have trouble cancelling it quickly otherwise'
        - 'Cancelling food is useful during enrage if you''re healing through it
          because Meteors do damage based on your max HP. Lower max HP means less
          damage taken, which means less damage to heal'
        - 'Cancelling your food when not at full HP also acts like a pseudo
          heal since it lowers your max HP, which actually raises your current
          HP%'
boss_job_specifics:
  BRD:
    timing:
      - "~7-8m with strength and 2 lusts - 1 at start and 1 for the final push
      (6.55)"
    notes:
      - "Steel required"
      - "Strength required for the final push, so you may as well have it up
        the entire fight!"
      - note: "Resolution strategy:"
        subnotes:
        - 'Slowly drag him clockwise around the arena, moving a bit each time
          he uses an ability so you''re at the end he''s going to Trounce from.
          This makes Trounce easy to avoid, and tornados are gone before you
          complete a lap'
        - "Pop lust at 22-23%. Get 5 stacks on the boss, then drop
          Transfiguration immediately"
        - "Bring the boss down as close to 15% as you can and make sure all
        your skills are off cooldown. Be very careful with DoTs because you
        want them up, but you don't want them to trigger enrage before you're
        ready. DoTs will do about 2-3% in the course of a full lap around the
        map."
        - "Pop Wanderer's Minuet a bit earlier (without other skills) so you
        have 3 stacks for Pitch Perfect at the start of the burst"
        - "Wait for the double Charybidis cast. During the first, pop
        Resolution, hit the boss once with it, then immediately cancel
        Resolution and start your burst (standard Minuet rotation/opener)"
      - "Be prepared for multiple attempts. You can play perfectly and still
      lose this fight. A win requires good luck with Pitch Perfect and Straight
      Shot procs."
  GNB:
    timing:
      - '< 10m with 1 strength and 1 lust (6.15)'
    notes:
      - 'Steel recommended for the later half of the fight to make burst setup
      easier'
      - 'Start the fight by the gate (where he spawns), making sure to spread
      out the tornados. Follow him across when he goes for Trounce and repeat
      the pattern there. This part of the fight is easy without steel'
      - 'Use strength (and steel if using) at 65% or when 8 minutes are
      remaining - whichever comes first'
      - 'Start saving Aurora, No Mercy, and cartridges around 28%'
      - 'Bring him to 19% and hold him there until he''s heading north for
      Trounce. As he does Trounce, use sustaining potion, some mitigation (but
      NOT Aurora), and Lust. Hit him with lust at least 5 times and more if
      necessary to get him to around 16.0% HP, then drop Transfiguration
      immediately'
      - 'Damage him slowly to between 15.3 and 15.1%, and then stop damage.
      You''ll start the burst during the double Charybdis cast on the opposite
      side'
      - note: 'Burst (tincture strat):'
        subnotes:
          - 'Make sure to keep Sustainings going until after the third meteor'
          - 'During the first Charybdis cast, use strength tincture and No
          Mercy'
          - 'As soon as the second Charybdis cast starts, begin your burst with
          Sonic Break into Gnashing Fang combo'
          - 'After meteor #1, wait a second, then use Superbolide and Aurora'
          - 'After meteor #2, cancel your food buff if you have it. See macro
          above for cancelling food. This will bring you up high enough to
          survive meteor #3'
          - 'Kill him before meteor #4!'
  MCH:
    timing:
      - '6m30m with strength and 1 lust (6.45)'
    notes:
      - Steel required
      - 'Strength required for the final push, so you may as well have it up
        the entire fight!'
      - Lust also required for the final push
      - 'Keep sustaining pots up 100% and you shouldn''t need to use Second
        Wind or max/super pots until the final push. If you use them, make sure
        the cooldown is over before starting the push'
      - note: 'There are two main strategies used for the burst phase. These
              will be detailed below. The first 85% of the fight is the same
              for both:'
        subnotes:
        - 'Slowly drag him clockwise around the arena, moving a bit each time
          he uses an ability so you''re at the end he''s going to Trounce from.

          complete a lap'
        - 'Start holding gauges at 30% so they can be full for the burst phase'
        - 'Stop damage at 21%. Wait until after Trounce from the south end,
          then whenever your Sustaining Potion wears, pop a fresh one, use
          Tactician, and Lust. Get 5 stacks on the boss, then drop
          Transfiguration immediately'
        - 'Damage him slowly down to 16% and then autoattack only until around
          15.2%. Be careful not to hit 15% until you''re ready for the burst
          phase'
        - 'If your HP is in good shape, you''re now ready to start the burst
          phase. Choose either the heal or tincture strat below'
      - note: 'Heal strat involves healing after the first meteor so you can
        survive a second one. You must kill the boss before the third meteor
        hits'
        subnotes:
          - note: 'Make sure sustaining doesn''t drop until the second meteor
            hits. If it does, use another RIGHT AWAY. You can afford to clip
            Heat Blast. You cannot afford to miss regen ticks'
            subnotes:
              - 'If you are full HP, wait until the first meteor cast is at 50%
                before popping another sustaining. This way, you won''t need to
                use another'
          - 'Wait for a double Charybdis cast'
          - note: 'During the first Charybdis:'
            subnotes:
              - Deploy turret

                  burst. Do not forget to refresh sustaining.'
            subnotes:
              - 'There are many variations of this rotation. You have a couple
                seconds to spare, so it doesn''t have to be perfect. This is
                what I (Daleven) do, and there is plenty of time to spare'
              - 'Burst 1: Drill > Gauss Round > Ricochet > Hot Shot > Wildfire
                Hypercharge combo > Split Shot'
              - 'Heal: HQ Super Potion > Second Wind. As of Endwalker,
                cancelling food is no longer necessary'
              - 'Burst 2: Hypercharge combo > Drill'
      - note: 'Tincture strat involves using a HQ Tincture of Dexterity (Grade
              4 or higher) instead in order to kill it before the second meteor
              hits. Note that tinctures share recast timer with health potions,
              so you cannot use both'
        subnotes:
        - note: 'Before you start:'
          subnotes:
            - 'Make sure you are almost full HP. Use Second Wind if needed'
            - 'Make sure sustaining is running and fresh enough to take you to
              full HP'
            - 'Use Tincture (just before Charybdis)'

Welcome to Behemoth's Domain! Lots of easy mobs in the first half, but the last
few floors can get rough. Try to conserve poms as much as possible, but don't
be afraid to blow a flight if you're short on time, or a raging if you get a
floor with a lot of Anzus and Sasquatches, bad debuffs, etc.

Make sure to pop raising immediately, assuming you either have 3 or are not
confident in your ability to clear the set. This is the last set where they
drop too.

Be aware of the [wall traps](/wall_traps.html#potd-151-199) on these floors.
