    subnotes:
      - 'Scalding Scolding'
      - note: 'Remedy Bomb (blue) spawns along with several untargetable Giddy
        Bombs'
        subnotes:
          - 'Remedy Bomb starts using Hypothermal Combustion immediately with a
            long cast time. It must be killed before this goes off to prevent
            massive roomwide damage (80% max HP damage + 5s deep freeze)'
          - 'Giddy Bombs all use Hypothermal Combustion after a few seconds.
            Theirs is a small telegraphed pointblank AoE with a short cast
            time, so stay away from them'
      - 'Sap (x3)'
      - 'Scalding Scolding'
      - 'Sap'
      - note: 'Lava Bomb (red) spawns along with several Giddy Bombs as the
        boss starts casting Massive Burst.'
        subnotes:
          - 'Massive Burst will do 99% max HP damage to everyone if it
            finishes'
          - 'Lava Bomb does a pointblank AoE that can interrupt the boss''s
            Massive Burst. It can be moved around by attacking it'
          - 'Giddy Bombs are the same as before, and can get in the way of your
            attempts to move the Lava Bomb if you''re not prepared'
  - 'Full rotation takes 1 minute, 20 seconds'
  - note: 'Remedy Bomb and Lava Bomb spawn locations are static. Knowing the
    spawn locations of Lava Bombs is especially useful, as you can then pull
    the boss to where it will spawn, allowing you to to keep uptime on the boss
    instead of running around to position the bomb'

  - 'DO NOT open with lust if soloing, as the cleave at the start will destroy
    you'
  - 'The safest time to use lust is during the triple Sap cast. Kill the Remedy
    Bomb as quickly as possible to maximize your time. DO NOT get greedy here.
    Drop transfiguration immediately regardless of stacks after the third Sap,
    as you need to be prepared for the cleave that follows'
  - 'Another option is to use Lust to kill the Remedy Bomb and get stacks on the
    boss at the same time. It will take 4 hits to kill the Remedy Bomb, so don''t
    delay'

Don't forget to use a pomander of raising at the start of the set. More cannot
be found here, unfortunately.

This is the scariest set in terms of the regular floors. 87-89 have absolutely
terrible mobs that you mostly won't want to fight solo. 86 can be bad too, but
is a bit more random in the enemies you'll see. The usual plan is to get as far
as you can with minimal pomander usage, and then use what you need to get
through the last few floors.

* Alterations are great here - if you get mandragoras, great! If you get
mimics, they're still much better than most of the other enemies.
* Rage is great, and there are a couple optimal ways to use it
  * Use fortune and clear the entire floor (or as much as possible), then go
    back to collect your loot. Even better if you planned ahead and used
    affluence as well.
  * Double-rage - collect as many chests as you can and locate the exit
    before-hand, then use rage, clear enemies close to the exit as quickly as
    possible and go into the portal with rage still active. You can then
    continue killing a few enemies on the next floor before it wears off.
* Flights are not great here as they don't combine well with alteration, and
  don't save you much time with rage either since the enemies are more
  spread out. Flight will save more time on the earlier floors that you're
  going to fight through if you need it.

Be aware of the [wall traps](/wall_traps.html#potd-151-199) on these floors.
