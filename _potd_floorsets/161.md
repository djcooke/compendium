    subnotes:
      - 'Drench'
      - 'Electrogenesis'
      - 'Douse'
      - 'Fang''s End'
  - 'Hit Sprint when it uses Drench if you''re still heavied to escape
    Electrogenesis safely. Only needed 1 out of every 5 times because of
    diminshing returns on the heavy (15s > 7s > 3s > resist > resist > 15s)'
  - 'If you''re kiting, it is a good idea to try to pull the boss to the same
    place every time for Douse. If they''re all stacked in one place, it''s
    much easier to keep the boss out of them, reducing damage taken'
  - 'If not kiting, simply pull him out of the puddle after Douse'

There are some hard-hitting dinosaurs here, but it's mostly easier than the
previous set.
