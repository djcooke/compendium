          - 'Flames appear around the edges of the arena and do telegraphed
            pointblank AoEs at the same time. Make sure to get knocked into a
            safe spot or use knockback immunity. The flames explode a couple
            seconds after the knockback, so there is a bit of time to adjust.
            Flame explosions deal 70% max HP damage'
