Beware of slime enrage and stay away from snakes if you hit a toading trap!
There are a good number of [wall traps](/wall_traps.html#potd-11-19) in donut
and dead-end rooms.

The Knockback Penalty enchantment does not appear in this set. Starting from
this set, floors can have up to 3 enchantments.

If solo, you probably want to full clear this set for exp.

Pomanders of rage, resolution, and raising do not drop at all on this set.
Affluence, flight, and alteration do not drop on floor 19.

Potsherds do not drop from bronze chests on floors 11-13.
