Beware of slime enrage and stay away from snakes if you hit a toading trap!
There is 1 known [wall trap](/wall_traps.html#potd-11-19).

If solo, you probably want to full clear this set for exp.

Pomanders of rage, resolution, and raising do not drop at all on this set.
Affluence, flight, and alteration do not drop on floor 19.
