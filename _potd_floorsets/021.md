Watch out for minotaur patrols' untelegraphed AoE. The pillar rooms are full of
[wall traps](/wall_traps.html#potd-21-29).

Starting from this set, all floor enchantments can appear.

Pomanders of resolution and raising do not drop at all on this set. Affluence,
flight, and alteration do not drop on floor 29.

Potsherds do not drop from bronze chests on floors 21-23.
