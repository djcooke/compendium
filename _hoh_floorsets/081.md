Don't forget to use a pomander of raising at the start of the set. More cannot
be found here, unfortunately. Be very careful if you're going for hoards!

Floors 84-86 are the worst, mainly due to Shinzei patrols that nobody wants to
fight. These are usually good candidates for
flight/alteration/petrification/magicite.

Floors 87-89 are known to have a lot of landmines. Tanks especially can use
pomander of sight on these floors to take advantage of this.
